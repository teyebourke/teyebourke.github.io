                <h1>Demon core</h1>
                <p>
                    The demon core was a sphere of plutonium 
                    that was involved in two fatal radiation 
                    accidents when scientists tested it as a 
                    fissile core of an early atomic bomb. 
                    It was manufactured in 1945 by the Manhattan 
                    Project, the U.S. nuclear weapon development 
                    effort during World War II. It was a subcritical 
                    mass that weighed 6.2 kilograms (14 lb) and was 
                    8.9 centimeters (3.5 in) in diameter. The core was 
                    prepared for shipment to the Pacific Theater as 
                    part of the third nuclear weapon to be dropped 
                    on Japan, but when Japan surrendered, 
                    the core was retained for testing and 
                    potential later use in the case of another 
                    conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two criticality accidents occurred at 
                    the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico on 
                    August 21, 1945, and May 21, 1946. In both 
                    cases, an experiment was intended to demonstrate 
                    how close the core was to criticality with a 
                    tamper (layer of dense material surrounding 
                    the fissile material). Still, the core was 
                    accidentally put into a critical configuration. 
                    Physicists Harry Daghlian (in the first accident) 
                    and Louis Slotin (in the second accident) both 
                    suffered acute radiation syndrome and died shortly 
                    afterward. At the same time, others present in the 
                    laboratory were also exposed. The core was melted 
                    down during the summer of 1946, and the material
                    was recycled for use in other cores.

                <p>
                    The demon core (like the core used in the bombing 
                    of Nagasaki) was, when assembled, a solid 
                    6.2-kilogram (14 lb) sphere measuring 8.9 
                    centimeters (3.5 in) in diameter. It consisted
                    of three parts made of plutonium-gallium: 
                    two hemispheres and an anti-jet ring, 
                    designed to keep neutron flux from "jetting" 
                    out of the joined surface between the hemispheres 
                    during implosion. The core of the device used in the 
                    Trinity Test at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery 
                    Range in July did not have such a ring.[1][2]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The refined plutonium was shipped from the 
                    Hanford Site in Washington to the Los Alamos 
                    Laboratory; an inventory document dated August 
                    30 shows Los Alamos had expended 
                    "HS-1, 2, 3, 4; R-1" (the components of the 
                    Trinity and Nagasaki bombs) and had in its 
                    possession "HS-5, 6; R-2", finished and in the 
                    hands of quality control. Material for "HS-7, R-3" 
                    was in the Los Alamos metallurgy section and 
                    would also be ready by September 5 (it is not 
                    certain whether this date allowed for the 
                    unmentioned "HS-8"'s fabrication to complete 
                    the fourth core).[3] The metallurgists used a
                    plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the 
                    delta (Î´) phase allotrope of plutonium so it 
                    could be hot pressed into the desired spherical 
                    shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, 
                    the sphere was then coated with nickel.[4]

                    On August 10, Major General Leslie R. Groves Jr.,
                    wrote to General of the Army George C. Marshall, 
                    the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, to 
                    inform him that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next bomb of the implosion type had been 
                    scheduled to be ready for delivery on the target 
                    on the first good weather after August 24th, 1945. 
                    We have gained 4 days in manufacture and expect to 
                    ship the final components from New Mexico on August 
                    12th or 13th. Providing there are no unforeseen 
                    difficulties in manufacture, in transportation to 
                    the theatre or after arrival in the theatre, the 
                    bomb should be ready for delivery on the first 
                    suitable weather after August 17th or 18th.[3]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marshall added an annotation, 
                    "It is not to be released on Japan without
                    express authority from the President", 
                    on President Harry S. Truman's orders.[3] 
                    On August 13, the third bomb was scheduled. 
                    It was anticipated that it would be ready by 
                    August 16 to be dropped on August 19.[3] 
                    This was pre-empted by Japan's surrender on 
                    August 15, 1945, while preparations were still 
                    being made for it to be couriered to Kirtland Field.
                    The third core remained at Los Alamos.[5]

                    The core, once assembled, was designed to be at 
                    "-5 cents".[6] In this state, there is only a small 
                    safety margin against extraneous factors that might 
                    increase reactivity, causing the core to become 
                    supercritical, and then prompt critical, a brief 
                    state of rapid energy increase.[7] These factors are 
                    not common in the environment; they are only likely 
                    to occur under conditions such as the compression of 
                    the solid metallic core (which would eventually be the 
                    method used to explode the bomb), the addition of
                    more nuclear material, or provision of an external 
                    reflector which would reflect outbound neutrons back 
                    into the core. The experiments conducted at Los 
                    Alamos leading to the two fatal accidents were 
                    designed to guarantee that the core was indeed 
                    close to the critical point by arranging such 
                    reflectors and seeing how much neutron reflection 
                    was required to approach supercriticality.[6]

                <p>
                    On August 21, 1945, the plutonium core 
                    produced a burst of neutron radiation that 
                    resulted in physicist Harry Daghlian's death. 
                    Daghlian made a mistake while performing neutron 
                    reflector experiments on the core. He was 
                    working alone; a security guard, Private Robert 
                    J. Hemmerly, was seated at a desk 10 to 12 
                    feet (3 to 4 m) away.[8] The core was placed 
                    within a stack of neutron-reflective tungsten 
                    carbide bricks, and the addition of each brick 
                    made the assembly closer to criticality. While 
                    attempting to stack another brick around the 
                    assembly, Daghlian accidentally dropped it 
                    onto the core and thereby caused the core to 
                    go well into supercriticality, a self-sustaining 
                    critical chain reaction. He quickly moved the 
                    brick off the assembly, but he received a fatal 
                    dose of radiation. He died 25 days later from 
                    acute radiation poisoning.[9]

                <p>
                    On May 21, 1946,[10] 
                    physicist Louis Slotin and seven other 
                    personnel were in a Los Alamos laboratory 
                    conducting another experiment to verify the 
                    closeness of the core to criticality by the 
                    positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, 
                    who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the 
                    technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would use 
                    it in a final test before the Operation 
                    Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month 
                    later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator 
                    to place two half-spheres of beryllium 
                    (a neutron reflector) around the core to be 
                    tested and manually lower the top reflector 
                    over the core using a thumb hole at the polar 
                    point. As the reflectors were manually moved 
                    closer and farther away from each other, 
                    neutron detectors indicated the core's neutron 
                    multiplication rate. The experimenter needed 
                    to maintain a slight separation between the 
                    reflector halves to allow enough neutrons to 
                    escape from the core in order to stay below 
                    criticality. The standard protocol was to use 
                    shims between the halves, as allowing them to 
                    close completely could result in the instantaneous 
                    formation of a critical mass and a lethal 
                    power excursion.

                <p>
                    The demon core was intended for use in the 
                    Operation Crossroads nuclear tests, 
                    but after the second criticality accident, 
                    time was needed for its radioactivity to 
                    decrease and for it to be re-evaluated for the 
                    effects of the fission products it held, some of 
                    which were very neutron poisonous to the desired 
                    level of fission. The next two cores were shipped 
                    for use in Able and Baker, and the demon core was 
                    scheduled to be shipped later for the third test of 
                    the series, provisionally named Charlie, but that 
                    test was canceled because of the unexpected level 
                    of radioactivity resulting from the underwater
                    Baker test and the inability to decontaminate 
                    the target warships. The core was melted down 
                    during the summer of 1946, and the material was 
                    recycled for use in other cores.[22]
