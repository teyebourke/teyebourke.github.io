                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    While on their way home from a trip, 
                    an elderly couple named Muriel and Eustace 
                    Bagge with their pink beagle, Courage, become 
                    caught in a storm, forcing them to stay for the 
                    night at the Katz Motel on the side of the highway. 
                    They are welcomed by the proprietor, Katz, who reveals 
                    that canines are strictly prohibited. Courage is forced 
                    to sleep outside the motel, while Muriel and Eustace 
                    attempt to settle in for the night. An unseen figure, 
                    presumably Katz, unleashes an enormous spider on Courage, 
                    before dropping another in Muriel's bath through the 
                    faucet. Courage barely escapes and begins searching 
                    for his owners, while Muriel is ambushed by the spider 
                    in the bathtub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Courage is alerted by her screams and launches himself 
                    through the window, only to discover Muriel being 
                    attacked by the monstrous spider down the toilet. 
                    Muriel instructs Courage to wake Eustace, but his 
                    efforts prove futile. Eustace's bed is revealed to 
                    be a hidden door when it flips, causing him to disappear. 
                    Courage discovers Eustace has disappeared and quickly 
                    goes to the lobby to get help, only to discover it empty. 
                    Upon further inspection, he discovers another room 
                    covered in spider webs, with an unconscious Eustace 
                    about to be consumed by a larger and deadlier spider. 
                    Courage pulls up a loose floorboard and crushes the 
                    creature underneath it, before rescuing a still 
                    sleeping Eustace. While Courage makes his escape 
                    carrying the still sleeping Eustace, Katz appears 
                    and blocks the way out, forcing Courage to toss 
                    Eustace's bound and unconscious form on him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Courage hides in the motel's basement, only to 
                    discover it is where Katz stores the spiders. 
                    A terrified Courage bursts through the door, 
                    knocking it loose from its hinges and onto an 
                    awaiting Katz, who quickly recovers. He corners 
                    Courage in a part of the basement and forces him to 
                    play a game of handball for his freedom. Meanwhile, 
                    Muriel is able to knock the spider into the toilet, 
                    flushing and drowning the creature. Katz triumphs over 
                    Courage in the game and proceeds to smother him with one 
                    of his spiders. However, Muriel appears and strikes Katz 
                    over the head with a badminton racket, dazing him and 
                    rescuing Courage. An irritated Muriel drives her dog and 
                    husband away from the motel, complaining about the awful 
                    service.
